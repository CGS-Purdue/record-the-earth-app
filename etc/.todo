TIP:

If the expo server and your device are not syncing up with the correct settings
it can be hard to know why your settings arent  working corretcly.

Open the chrome devtools network monitor and you can see if theres a issue very quickly
you can also send the server the inital package directly in the browser url bar
and if you reload the device these settinsg will stick until you change them again

example:
```
http://localhost:19001/node_modules/expo/AppEntry.delta?platform=android&dev=true&minify=false&hot=false&revisionId=1522189e5d0527b7
```
