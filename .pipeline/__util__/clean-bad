# YOU SHOULD NOT REMOVE FILES FROM A SCRIPT OR function
# AND BE ESPECIALLY CAREFUL IF THEOSE SCRIPTS ACCEPT VARIABLES RO INPUT


# AN EQUAL SOLUTION BUT ONE THAT IS MUCH SAFER WOULD INVOLVE MOVING THE
# UNWANTED FOLDERS TO A TEMPORARY LOCATION AND ONLY ALLOW YOUR SCRIPT
# TO REMOVE SPECIFIC PATHS FROM THAT SPOT. THIS AT LEAST IN A WAY CHROOTS
# THESE COMMANDS AND PREVENTS THEM FROM ACCIDENTALLY DELETING YORU PROJET OR
# YOUR ENTIRE SERVER.

# PEOPLE THAT REGULARLY WRITE WCRIPTS LIKE THIS ARE ALSO LIKELY TO USE SUDO <THIS>
# AT THE FIRST SIGN SOMETHING DIDNT' WORK. THE ABOVE PATTERN SI SETTINGS YOURSELF UP
# UNHAPPY SITUATION.

# OR HOW ABOUT IF $TEMPDIR HAS A SPACE IN THE MIDDLE BECAUSE SOMEONE WANTS TO USE
# WINDOWS FOR "PHOTOSHOP". .. YOU'RE SCREWED, SOMETHIGN IS GETTING DELETED. HOPEFULLY
# ITS SOMETHING YOU DON'T HAVE READ/WRITE ACCESS TO.

# A SECONDARY NOTE IS THAT WE DON'T REALLY NEED TO WIPE TEH ENTIRE node_modules DIRECTORY
# AND REINSTALL AS OFTEN ENOUGH THAT IT WOULD BE USEFUL IN A SCRIPT.
# NODE MODULES FOLDER IS SOMETIMES HUGE AND HAS PRE AND POST HOOKS, LINT CHECKS AND OFTEN
# BUILDS GIANT PROGRAMS FROM SOURCE LIKE ELECTRON OR THE CHROME ENGINE.

# IF YOURE DOING THIS BECEUASE YOU THNK IT SOLVES A PROBLEM YOU'RE HAVING THEM MOST LIKELY
# THERE IS SOMETHING INCORRECT IN YORU USER CONFIGURATION THAT WOULD LET YOU NOT HAVE TO
# DO THIS UNLESS THERE WAS A GOOD REASON, LIKE MAJOR VERSION UPDATES OR MIGRATING TO A NEW
# FRAMEWORK.

## IF YOU READ THROUGH THE NPM DOCUMENTATION THEY VERY CLEARLY STATE THAT CLEARING THE CACHE
# IS NOT RECOMENDED AND ALTHOGUH I DONT HTINK THERES SPECIFIC COMMENTS ABOUT WIPING THE WHOLE FOLDER,
# I AM VERY CERTAIN THERE IS NO CLEAR BENEFITS OR GOOD REASON TO DO THIS EVEN IF IT AT WORST HAS
# NO EFFECT AT ALL.

# A SLIGHTLY SAFTER / MORE MORE GENERAL VERSION .
